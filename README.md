##Intro to Inclusivity and Diversity in Tech:

This primer is a collection of introductory materials on inclusivity and diversity in the tech industry. Most of the articles below address racial and gender diversity and intersections of the two. This is not to say that these are the only types of diversity worth highlighting. These are, however, the dominant discussions in the industry today, and the conversations where perspectives of the individuals from the highlighted marginalized groups themselves are most readily found.

We welcome outside feedback and addition to this resource guide.

* Take a look at the chart labeled “Diversity in Tech”. The default view is set to men of all races.
    *  Click the button to show women. Note that while men represent an average of 71% of a company’s workers, women represent 29%, meaning that men are more than 2x as likely to be represented than women
    * Click back to show the default view of men of all ethnicities. Now click through the racial categories. Compare these numbers to national workforce demographics featured at the top of the article.
    * Now, select each racial category, and toggle the gender selection.
* Repeat this with the “Diversity in Leadership” chart. Compare data for each company against the same data for that company in the previous chart.


[StackOverflow Developer Survey 2015](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015)

* The limited survey response data shows that the majority of women developers have been in the field for less than two years. 
* Stack Overflow is optimistic that this might mean more women are entering the industry and are newbies. 
* Alternatively, there’s been [many](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html) [an article](http://fortune.com/2014/10/02/women-leave-tech-culture/) [published](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/if-you-think-women-in-tech-is-just-a-pipeline-problem-you-haven-t-been-paying-attention-cb7a2073b996#.8yo3vokfa) on why women leave tech. The survey numbers may reflect a low retention rate.

###Why does tech face this problem?

[Three issues facing the tech industry that impact diversity](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/issues-facing-tech-industry-diversity) - Code Fellows 12/1/15

* Scarcity
    - Lack of diversity stems from the larger issue facing tech: scarcity. There simply aren't enough developers to go around, whether they're male or female, African American or Asian, Hispanic or white. With supply so far below demand, companies … are doing little to rock the boat in an industry that already has a high turnover rate.
* Training and Access
    - Computer science degrees have been the primary educational path to a career in programming, but cost anywhere from $7,000 to $35,000 per year at community and state colleges, and even more at private universities. That figure doesn't account for room, board, or the two to four years it takes to complete the program.
    - More and more developers are self-taught but, “For students who decide to pursue a degree or learn to program on their own, they've likely had independent encouragement and opportunities along the way that aren't afforded to all young students. Despite a push for more computer science programs in K-12 schools, AP computer science classes are only in 5 percent of high schools. Only 26 states allow computer science classes to count towards graduation requirements. This means students aren't given full opportunity to explore computer science unless they come across it on their own and have ample access to a computer, and Hispanic and African American households are less likely than Caucasian households to have access to a desktop or laptop computer at home.”
* Support
    - According to a 2008 Harvard study, there are five reasons why women leave the tech industry:
        * Hostility in the workplace
        * The dispiriting sense of isolation
        * A disconnect between preferred work rhythms and riskier behavior rewarded in male-dominated fields
        * Long workweeks and punishing travel schedules on top of household management
        * Lack of access to mentors and clear pathways for career advancement
        * While the exclusion is often unintentional, the assumptions around women and minorities and the pressure to fit in with the "geek" culture is pushing out those who don't fit a specific stereotype.


[The Core Belief Keeping Marginalized Groups out of Tech](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-core-belief-keeping-marginalized-groups-out-of-tech) - Model View Culture 2/4/16

* A large-scale, national study run out of the University of Illinois set out to test for:
    - gender differences in willingness or ability to work long hours;
    - gender differences in the high end of the aptitude distribution (in other words, ability);
    - the extent to which a particular discipline requires systemizing (the need to understand abstract principles and rules) over empathizing (the need to understand human thoughts and feelings); and
    - the extent to which practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success.
* The study found there were no significant differences between men and women in the willingness or ability to work long hours, no significant differences between men and women in aptitude, and no significant gender differences around the systematic vs. empathetic nature of the field. 
* The only significant differences were in the beliefs that innate talent was required for success. In other words, **fields where professionals believed innate ability and raw talent were required for success had significantly less women.** These fields? Math, physics, computer science, and engineering.
